As a Front-end Developer at lexawise.com, I not only designed, built, and optimized the client-side of the application, but I also addressed several crucial areas like bug fixes and SEO optimization. While using ReactJS, a robust and scalable JavaScript library, I created innovative, user-focused designs and interfaces that provided a seamless and interactive user experience. I wrote reusable components, managed state and props, utilized React hooks, and handled events.

Another important aspect of my work was performing regular API calls which allowed me to update the web content dynamically. I routinely tested and debugged the application, spending considerable time identifying, diagnosing, and fixing bugs. This process vastly improved the application's performance and reliability.

Moreover, I put a strong focus on search engine optimization. I implemented SEO best practices, like creating search-friendly URLs, including relevant keywords in content, and utilizing meta tags. This ensured that our web pages were easily discoverable and ranked higher in search results, thereby driving more organic traffic to the site.

Part of my main responsibilities was to ensure the app's optimal speed, scalability, and its responsive and consistent interface across various devices. All in all, my work eliminated bugs, increased the application's visibility to search engines, and enhanced the overall user experience.
